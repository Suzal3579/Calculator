<h1 style = "text-align:center;"> React Calculator</h1>

<h1 style = "text-align:center;"> Why I made this?</h1>
<br>

- Because this was one of the challenges in **FREE CODE CAMP** front end certification.

- I was interested in making a calculator to figure out how things work (Was simple in fact).

<h1 style = "text-align:center;"> How do I start?</h1>
<br>

- `npm install` in the project directory.

- `npm start` to start the server at port 3000.

- Done, It's that simple.
